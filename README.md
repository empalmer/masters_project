# Masters Project at Oregon State University Spring 2021


### Overview
Following [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008108), I am using a tree-based correlation structure and integrating with longitudinal correlation structure for microbiome data. Using generalized estimating equations for model fitting.

Abstract:
The Microbiome Taxonomic Longitudinal Correlation, a recent model for microbiome association studies, was explored in detail and code was developed for application in general datasets beyond the case study provided in the initial paper. Applications of this method provided computational challenges when the scale of the data is beyond a small number of selected OTUs.
