# Masters Project at Oregon State University Spring 2021


### Overview
Following [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008108), I am using a tree-based correlation structure and integrating with longitudinal correlation structure for microbiome data. Using generalized estimating equations for model fitting.

### Current status:
Working on getting the code working on a case study

### Goals:

- Apply to larger dataset, the paper in the dataset only has 9 OTUs, 2 repeated measures
- Also adjust taking into account sequencing depth, instead of using relative abundance
