# Masters Project at Oregon State University Spring 2021

## Topic:

My masters project research:

Following this paper I presented last term that uses GEEs on tree based - correlated microbiome longitudinal measures

Working on getting the code working on a case study
Apply to a more realistic dataset, this paper only has 9 outs, 2 repeated measures

Also adjust taking into account sequencing depth, instead of using relative abundance
