American Gut data questions 

Samples - some are repeated measures on different cites? 

OTUs - some have the same taxonomic information to species level? 

Is there a good way to lessen the number of correlations to estimate? 
Maybe remove higher level correlations?? 

For the American Gut data, there are two groups at the top level. Will this change anything?
